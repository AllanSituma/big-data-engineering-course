### **Lesson Notes: Introduction to Dimensional Modeling with Practical Implementation using dbt**

#### **1. Introduction to Dimensional Modeling**

**a. Overview of Data Warehousing Concepts**

- **Data Warehousing:**
  - A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores integrated data from multiple sources, optimized for query and analysis.
  - OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) focuses on complex queries and aggregations, supporting business intelligence activities.

- **Dimensional Modeling:**
  - A design approach for structuring data in a data warehouse.
  - Prioritizes simplicity and query performance, making it easier for analysts to retrieve and analyze data.

**b. Understanding Fact and Dimension Tables**

- **Fact Tables:**
  - **Definition:** Central tables in a star schema that store quantitative data (measures) related to a specific business process.
  - **Key Characteristics:**
    - **Grain:** The level of detail captured (e.g., individual sales transactions).
    - **Measures:** Numeric values for analysis (e.g., revenue, quantity).
    - **Foreign Keys:** Link to dimension tables.
  - **Examples:** 
    - Sales, orders, transactions.

- **Dimension Tables:**
  - **Definition:** Surround fact tables and provide descriptive context (who, what, when, where, why).
  - **Key Characteristics:**
    - **Attributes:** Descriptive fields (e.g., customer name, product category).
    - **Hierarchies:** Enable drill-down analysis (e.g., date -> month -> year).
  - **Examples:**
    - Customer, product, date.

**c. Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema**

- **Star Schema:**
  - **Structure:** Fact table in the center, surrounded by dimension tables.
  - **Advantages:** Simplicity, fast query performance, easy to understand.
  - **Use Case:** When simplicity and performance are key.

- **Snowflake Schema:**
  - **Structure:** A more normalized version of the star schema, where dimension tables are further broken down.
  - **Advantages:** Saves storage space, reduces data redundancy.
  - **Use Case:** When data is highly normalized, and storage efficiency is important.

**d. The Process of Dimensional Modeling**

- **Steps in Dimensional Modeling:**
  1. **Identify the Business Process:** Focus on key processes like sales, orders, or inventory.
  2. **Declare the Grain:** Determine the most detailed level of data to store in the fact table (e.g., each individual sale).
  3. **Choose the Dimensions:** Identify the key entities that describe the fact (e.g., customer, product, time).
  4. **Identify the Facts:** Select the metrics that will be analyzed (e.g., sales amount, quantity sold).

- **Best Practices:**
  - **Consistency:** Ensure consistent grain across fact tables.
  - **Simplicity:** Keep dimension tables denormalized for ease of use.
  - **Scalability:** Design with future growth in mind.

#### **2. Practical Implementation with dbt (80 minutes)**

**a. Introduction to dbt and Its Role in Data Transformation (5 minutes)**

- **dbt (Data Build Tool):**
  - A command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in the warehouse using SQL.
  - Promotes version control, documentation, testing, and modular SQL development.

- **Role in Dimensional Modeling:**
  - dbt automates the process of building fact and dimension tables from raw data.
  - Allows for easy iteration and testing of models.

**b. Setting Up the Environment (10 minutes)**

- **dbt Setup:**
  - **Installation:** Ensure dbt is installed in the environment.
  - **Project Initialization:** `dbt init my_project` to create a new project.
  - **Configuration:**
    - Edit `profiles.yml` to configure the connection to the data warehouse (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    - Use sample data like the Chinook database for practice.

**c. Creating a Basic Star Schema with dbt (30 minutes)**

- **Step 1: Creating the Fact Table (15 minutes)**
  - **Define the Grain:** 
    - Example: Each row represents a single sales transaction.
  - **Aggregate Measures:** 
    - Calculate total sales, quantity, and other relevant metrics.
  - **SQL Example:**
    ```sql
    select
        invoice_id,
        customer_id,
        employee_id,
        store_id,
        purchase_date,
        sum(quantity) as total_quantity,
        sum(unit_price * quantity) as total_sales,
        sum(unit

    _price * quantity * (1 - discount)) as total_revenue
    from
        raw.sales
    group by
        invoice_id, customer_id, employee_id, store_id, purchase_date
    ```
  - **Create dbt Model:**
    - Save the SQL in the `models` directory as `sales_fact.sql`.
    - Run the model using `dbt run`.

- **Step 2: Creating Dimension Tables (15 minutes)**
  - **Customer Dimension:**
    - **Attributes:** First name, last name, email, address, etc.
    - **SQL Example:**
    ```sql
    select
        customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        email,
        phone,
        address,
        city,
        state,
        country,
        postal_code
    from
        raw.customers
    ```
    - **Create dbt Model:** Save as `customer
